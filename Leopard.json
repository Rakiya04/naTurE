          "description": "Horton Plains National Park is one of the last remaining highland wilderness refuges. One of Mother Nature's most breathtaking marvels, this montane wilderness is perched atop a high plateau at an elevation of more than 2500 metres above sea level. With perseverance and innumerable visits over the past few years, this has also resulted in some incredible leopard encounters. The most important landscapes of this habitat are the deep, dense cloud forests and the edges of the open plains, which are home to these predators, who rule this domain. With their diet consisting mostly of Sambhur, the largest deer species in Sri Lanka, these cats appear to differ physiologically from their cousins in the lowlands.",
