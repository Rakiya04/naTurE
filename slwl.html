            <p>Minneriya National Park is located in Sri Lanka's North Central Province, 182 kilometers from Colombo. The major cities closest to Minneriya National Park are Habarana and Polonnaruwa. The renovated, vast ancient Minneriya Rainwater Reservoir that irrigates a considerable area of the district of Polonnaruwa is the focal point of the Minneriya National Park. Minneriya National Park, which is part of the elephant corridor that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National Parks, provides visitors with the opportunity to see elephant herds all year. May to October is the best period to visit Minneriya National Park in view of the world-famous Great Elephant Gathering of the Asian wild elephants. During this period, herds of up to 350 elephants are seen at the 8,890-hectare park within a few square kilometers of the Minneriya Tank. According to some reports, there are as many as 700 elephants. In August and September each year, during the dry season, wild elephants migrate from Wasgamuwa National Park to Minneriya National Park in search of food and shelter. Tourists visit Minneriya National Park largely because of elephants, especially in the dry season.</p>
